    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Our group decided to hew close to the major theme of our class and trained our teachable machine to detect skin-tone from light to dark. We noticed right away that the model had difficulty, mostly reported skin-tones as dark, despite robust data-sets and trouble-shooting. Referencing our data sets, we set up a frame using p5js to see if a particular region of the screen helped with detection, but this was unsuccessful. We each explore the reasons behind the difficulty with classification in our individual <a href="project-statements.html">project statements</a>. In initial group discussions we considered the possibility of algorithmic bias, and the hurdles presented by the "black-box" of the teachable-machines interface.
