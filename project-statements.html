    <h2>Our Personal Project Statements</h2>
    <p>
        For this assignment, each member of our team created their own personal project statement
        reflecting on the experience of building our Teachable Machine model and connecting it
        to ideas from <em>Unmasking AI</em>. Writing individual statements let us explain our own
        perspectives, our roles in the project, and the lessons we took from experimenting with a
        machine learning model that tries to identify skin tone through a webcam.

        <p>
            For this project I spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to build something
            that tries to classify people in any way. Working through this assignment after reading
            Buolamwini’s book made me more aware of how much is happening under the surface of even
            the simplest machine learning model. Earlier in the semester we used GitHub while building
            our Project 2 website, so coming into this assignment I already felt a little more confident.
            This project pushed that further because we were not only keeping the same style guide and
            structure from before, we were also refining how we collaborated as a group. We planned our
            pages more intentionally and divided the work in a way that let each of us focus on something
            meaningful while still keeping everything consistent across the site.

        <p>
            One of the biggest pieces of this assignment was deciding what our algorithm would actually do.
            We talked a lot about the experiences Buolamwini describes and how facial analysis systems
            repeatedly fail on darker skin tones, or misread faces entirely. That helped us decide that
            instead of a face recognition model or something complicated, we wanted to build a simple
            Teachable Machine model that tries to read skin tone through a user’s webcam. It felt like a
            way to explore the issues she wrote about without pretending we could solve them. We were more
            interested in seeing how the model behaved and what that would tell us about the limits built
            into this kind of tool.
           
         <p>
            As we trained our classes we realized quickly that the model was not identifying anything in a
            smooth or accurate way. Even when we provided different lighting and angles, it still leaned
            toward misclassifying skin tones. It often labeled things as “dark” even when the person’s skin
            tone was lighter or medium. Sometimes it ignored the person entirely and picked up the background.
            Seeing those mistakes reminded me of how biased these systems are right from the start. The model
            is supposed to reflect whatever data you give it, but even when we tried to be intentional, we saw
            the same issues Buolamwini described. It reinforced the idea that the bias is not only in the data.
            It is built into the way these systems work.
       
        <p>
            This experience connected directly to some of the moments in the book where she talks about feeling
            unseen by the systems she was testing. I started thinking about how frustrating it would be to depend
            on a tool like this in a real situation. Ours was just a simple classroom project and even here it
            struggled to make sense of something as basic as skin tone. The bigger picture is that people are
            judged by these systems all the time, and reading her story made that feel more real while we were
            building our own small version.

         <p>
            Another part of the project that stood out to me was learning more about how to structure a GitHub
            repository in a way that actually supports a collaborative workflow. Last time it felt like we were
            learning as we went. This time we already knew the basic setup so we could focus on the
            actual organization of the files and refining the website. It made collaborating easier and it showed
            me how helpful version control can be when you have several people editing the same project.

         <p>
            Overall, working on this assignment while thinking about Buolamwini’s lessons made the whole process
            feel more intentional. It was not just a project about building a model. It was also about
            understanding how these systems carry bias, even when the people building them are trying to be
            careful. Seeing our own model misread us proved her point in a real and honestly uncomfortable way.

         <p>
            More than anything, I walked away with a better understanding of how technical work and ethical
            thinking need to happen at the same time. You cannot build something first and then worry about
            the impact later. Even a small classroom project can reveal the problems that show up in larger
            systems. This assignment helped me see that clearly.
