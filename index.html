        Welcome to our LIS 500 Project 3 site! For this assignment, our group created a custom 
        Teachable Machine image-classification model inspired by themes from Joy Buolamwini’s 
        <em>Unmasking AI</em>.  
        <br><br>
        Our goal was to explore how machine learning systems interpret visual data and how 
        concepts like bias, representation, and power show up in these systems. We selected 
        a subject related to the themes of the book, gathered images, trained a model through 
        Teachable Machine, and then reflected individually on the implications of algorithmic 
        decision-making.  
        <br><br>
        Each of us has written a personal project statement, included on the “Lessons Learned” 
        page, where we discuss what resonated with us from <em>Unmasking AI</em> and how the 
        hands-on ML activity shaped our understanding of the relationship between technology, 
        data, and social justice.
