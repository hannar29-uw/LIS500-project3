    <h2>Project Scope</h2>

    <p>
        The scope of our LIS 500 Project 3 centers on exploring how machine learning models classify and interpret human skin tones 
        and visualizing user interactions with interactive code using p5.js. Our main goal was to build a simple Teachable Machine model 
        capable of receiving webcam input and attempting to categorize skin tones in real time, while documenting biases and limitations 
        that arise due to training data constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we created a p5.js project to demonstrate interactive programming and dynamic visualizations. 
        This portion of the project allowed us to explore creative coding, user input, and data-driven visuals, complementing our machine learning component.

            <h3>In Scope</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Building a Teachable Machine model to classify skin tones using webcam input</li>
                <li>Testing and documenting model behavior and biases</li>
                <li>Creating interactive visualizations using p5.js</li>
                <li>Producing videos and a webpage to demonstrate both projects</li>
                <li>Collaborating as a team to establish a consistent style guide and workflow</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Advanced machine learning techniques beyond the Teachable Machine platform</li>
                <li>Creating a fully deployed web application with server-side code</li>
                <li>Collecting a fully representative dataset for skin tones</li>
                <li>Integrating the p5.js project directly with the Teachable Machine model</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Overall, the project scope allowed us to explore machine learning and creative coding in a controlled environment, 
        focusing on understanding model behavior, user interaction, and bias in algorithms while producing tangible outputs for demonstration.
